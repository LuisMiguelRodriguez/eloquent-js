## Looping a Triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 ( and not 3), print "Buzz".

When you have that working , modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

## Chess Board

Write a program that creates a string that represents and 8 x 8 grid, using newline characters to seperate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "# character. The characters should form a chess board. Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

```
# # # #
 # # #
# # # #
 # # #
# # # #
 # # #
# # # #
 # # #
```

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
