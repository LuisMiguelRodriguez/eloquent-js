// ## Bean Counting

// You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing 
// "string".charAt(N), similiar to how you get this "s".length. The 
// returned valuewill be a string containing only one character (for
//  example, "b"_. The first character has position zero, which causes 
// the last one to be found at positin string.length -1. In other words,
// a two-chracter string has length 2, and its characters have position 0 and 1.).

// Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters are in the string.

// Next, write a function called countChar that behave like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be
// counted ( rather than counting only uppercase "B" character). Rewrite  countBs to make use of this new function.

const functions = {
    countB (str) {
        let count = 0;
        let arr = str.split('');

        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i] == "B"){
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
        
    },
    countChar (str, char) {
        let count = 0;
        let arr = str.split('');

        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            if( arr[i] == char){
                count++;
            }
        }
